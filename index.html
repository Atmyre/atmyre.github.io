            <p>Hey! ðŸ‘‹</p>

<p>I am a PhD student at Digital Environment Research Institute (Queen Mary University of London), supervised by Prof. <a href="https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~gslabaugh/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Gregory Slabaugh</a> and Dr. <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/maths/profiles/benningmartin.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Martin Benning</a>. My work is supported by <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/education" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DeepMind studentship</a>.</p>

<p>My research interests mostly include computer vision, diffusion models, explainability and knowledge extraction. I am also interested in fundamental topics of deep learning, such as optimization, structural representation in neural networks and robustness.</p>

<p>Previously, I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Applied Mathematics from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT) and Masterâ€™s degrees in Data Analysis from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology and Yandex School of Data Analysis (YSDA). After graduation I worked as an AI researcher at Huawei Russian Research Institute and Philips Innovation Labs.</p>

<p>I have rich experience in teaching machine learning and deep learning courses. I am a founding member, methodologist and lecturer of Deep Learning School (MIPT). Additionally, I teach classes at Moscow State University, Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology and other places (visit â€˜teachingâ€™ page for more info).</p>

<p>In my spare time a enjoy reading, walking, doing fitness, playing voleyball and spending time with friends. I am also really interested in neurobiology, phychology and connections between them and ideas of AI models.</p>
